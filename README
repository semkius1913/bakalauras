This is my bachelor degree thesis "Biogeography based optimization methods" (written in Lithuanian).

This thesis includes biogeography – based optimization method analysis which is one of the
evolutionary optimization methods. Various evolutionary methods are reviewed as well as biogeographical
and full re-sampling algorithms are described. Research includes the analysis of benefits
of biogeography – based optimization method for solving a specific problem. The problem is defined:
to find the largest colored square in each color-shaded area with each pixel of the same color
in 64x64 pixel image. The results shows that the method of the study can speed up the search and
give results faster than the full re-sampling algorithm.
